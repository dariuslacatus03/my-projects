Test1's configuration:
- table T1: NoOfRows = 10000, Position = 1
- table T2: NoOfRows = 2000, Position = 2
- table T3: NoOfRows = 500, Position = 3
- views V1, V2


run Test1 => test run with TestRunId = 7
- delete all rows from T1
- delete all rows from T2
- delete all rows from T3
- insert 500 rows into T3
- insert 2000 rows into T2
- insert 10000 rows into T1
- SELECT * FROM V1
- SELECT * FROM V2

For test run with TestRunId = 7: 
- store its "StartAt", "EndAt" in TestRuns
- for the INSERT on T3: store its "StartAt", "EndAt" in TestRunTables
- for the INSERT on T2: store its "StartAt", "EndAt" in TestRunTables
- for the INSERT on T1: store its "StartAt", "EndAt" in TestRunTables
- for the SELECT on V1: store its "StartAt", "EndAt" in TestRunViews
- for the SELECT on V2: store its "StartAt", "EndAt" in TestRunViews
