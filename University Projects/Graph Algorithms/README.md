### Graph Algorithms

This Python application offers practical implementations of fundamental graph theory concepts, featuring both directed and undirected graph structures. 

Through clear examples, the project explores essential graph algorithms, including:
**(1)** Breadth-First Search (BFS)
**(2)** Lowest Cost Walk using a matrix defined as: d[x,k] = the cost of the lowest cost walk from s to x and of length at most k, where s is the starting vertex
**(3)** Kruskal's Algorithm
