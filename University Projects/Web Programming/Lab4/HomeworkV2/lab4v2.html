<!-- Write an HTML page that contains a table having four lines and four columns. 
The table's cells contain distinct random numbers from 1 to 15 (one of the cells 
being empty). Using JavaScript create a puzzle game that the user must solve. 
You will create a second version of the game, where numbers are replaced by small 
images, initially part of a bigger image. For slicing the original image in smaller 
pieces you may use picture editing software such as Photoshop or Gimp. -->
